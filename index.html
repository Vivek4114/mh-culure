      <h2 style="font-size: 36px;"> Historical Legacy of Maharashtra</h2>
      <p>
        Maharashtra has a rich and inspiring historical legacy, deeply rooted in the valor, wisdom, and cultural pride
        of its people. One of the most significant figures in its history is **Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj**, the great
        Maratha warrior king who founded the **Maratha Empire** in the 17th century. Known for his brilliant military
        strategies, progressive governance, and respect for all religions, Shivaji Maharaj established a powerful
        kingdom and built a network of forts across the Western Ghats, including **Raigad**, **Sinhagad**,
        **Pratapgad**, and **Shivneri**.

        The state has witnessed various important historical phases—from ancient times under the **Satavahanas**,
        **Vakatakas**, and **Yadavas**, to the medieval period dominated by the **Bahmani Sultanate** and later the
        **Mughals**. The Maratha Empire rose to challenge Mughal dominance, and under leaders like **Peshwa Bajirao**,
        it expanded across large parts of India.

        Maharashtra also played a key role during India’s freedom struggle. Cities like **Pune** and **Mumbai** became
        centers for political thought and revolutionary movements. Leaders like **Bal Gangadhar Tilak** and **Gopal
        Krishna Gokhale** emerged from here.

        Today, the forts, palaces, ancient temples, and historic cities stand as proud reminders of Maharashtra’s
        glorious past, inspiring generations to value bravery, justice, and cultural heritage.

      <p>


        **Marathi** is an Indo-Aryan language spoken predominantly in the Indian state of **Maharashtra**, as well as
        parts of Goa, Karnataka, and Madhya Pradesh. It is the **official language of Maharashtra** and one of the **22
        scheduled languages of India**. Marathi has a long literary tradition and is one of the oldest regional
        languages in India, with roots dating back over a thousand years.

        The language is written in the **Devanagari script**, the same script used for Sanskrit and Hindi. However,
        Marathi has unique sounds and grammatical rules that set it apart from other languages in the same family. It
        has a rich vocabulary influenced by **Sanskrit**, **Persian**, **Arabic**, and **English** due to historical and
        cultural interactions.

        Marathi literature includes poetry, novels, plays, and devotional works. Famous Marathi writers include **Sant
        Tukaram**, **Sant Dnyaneshwar**, and modern authors like **P. L. Deshpande** and **V. S. Khandekar**.

        Today, over **83 million people** speak Marathi, making it one of the most spoken languages in India. It plays a
        vital role in the cultural identity of Maharashtra and continues to thrive through literature, films, theatre,
        and education.
