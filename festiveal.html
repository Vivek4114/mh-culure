        <h2> * Diwali *</h2>
      </center>
      <p>
        Diwali, also known as Deepavali, is one of the most important festivals celebrated in India. It is known as the
        "Festival of Lights" and symbolizes the victory of light over darkness and good over evil. Diwali usually falls
        in October or November and is celebrated over five days. People decorate their homes with oil lamps (diyas),
        candles, and colorful rangoli designs. Firecrackers are burst to mark the celebration, and sweets are shared
        with family and friends.

        The festival has religious significance for Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, and some Buddhists. For Hindus, it marks the
        return of Lord Rama to Ayodhya after defeating Ravana. People worship Goddess Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth,
        and seek her blessings for prosperity. Markets are full of festive items, and people buy new clothes and gifts.
        Diwali is a time of joy, family gatherings, and renewal, making it one of the most cherished festivals in Indian
        culture.

        <h2> * Raksha-Bandhan *</h2>
      </center>
      <p>
        Raksha Bandhan is a popular Indian festival that celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters. It is usually
        observed in the month of August, on the full moon day of the Hindu month of Shravan. On this day, sisters tie a
        sacred thread called a rakhi around their brothers' wrists, symbolizing love, protection, and care. In return,
        brothers give gifts and promise to protect their sisters throughout their lives.

        The festival reflects the deep emotional connection between siblings. Families come together to celebrate, and
        traditional sweets are shared. Though originally a Hindu festival, Raksha Bandhan is now celebrated by people of
        many communities across India.

        In modern times, the festival has expanded beyond biological siblings, with people tying rakhis to friends,
        neighbors, or even soldiers as a sign of respect and affection. Raksha Bandhan is a beautiful reminder of the
        importance of love, duty, and mutual respect in relationships.

        <h2> * Gudi- Padwa *</h2>
      </center>
      <p>
        Gudi Padwa is a traditional Hindu festival celebrated mainly in Maharashtra and parts of South India. It marks
        the beginning of the New Year as per the Marathi lunar calendar and usually falls in March or April. Gudi Padwa
        is also celebrated as Ugadi in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Telangana.

        The festival symbolizes prosperity, success, and new beginnings. On this day, people clean and decorate their
        homes with rangoli and flowers. A special flag called a Gudi is hoisted outside homes—it consists of a bright
        silk cloth adorned with flowers, neem leaves, a sugar garland, and a copper or silver pot on top. It is believed
        to ward off evil and invite good luck.

        Traditional dishes like puran poli and shrikhand are prepared and enjoyed with family. Gudi Padwa is also
        associated with the harvest season and celebrates the arrival of spring, bringing hope and positivity for the
        year ahead.

        <h2> * Makar-Sankranti *</h2>
      </center>
      <p>
        Makar Sankranti is a major Hindu festival celebrated across India, marking the transition of the Sun into the
        zodiac sign of Capricorn (Makara). It usually falls on January 14th and is one of the few Hindu festivals based
        on the solar calendar. The festival signifies the end of the winter solstice and the beginning of longer, warmer
        days.

        Makar Sankranti is a harvest festival, especially important to farmers. People express gratitude for a good
        harvest and pray for prosperity. In many states, flying kites is a major highlight, especially in Gujarat and
        Maharashtra, where the skies are filled with colorful kites.

        People also prepare and share traditional sweets like tilgul (sesame and jaggery), symbolizing togetherness and
        goodwill. Different regions celebrate it in unique ways—Pongal in Tamil Nadu, Lohri in Punjab, and Uttarayan in
        Gujarat.

        Makar Sankranti promotes values of unity, gratitude, and joy, making it a cherished festival for all.

      <p>
        Holi is a vibrant and joyful Hindu festival, widely known as the Festival of Colors. It is celebrated in March, marking the arrival of spring and the victory of good over evil. The festival begins with Holika Dahan, a bonfire ritual symbolizing the burning of evil, followed by a day of playful color-throwing and celebration.

On Holi, people of all ages smear each other with colored powders, splash water, and enjoy festive music and dance. Streets and homes come alive with laughter and joy. Traditional sweets like gujiya, malpua, and thandai are shared with friends and family.

Holi also has mythological significance, especially the story of Prahlad and Holika, representing devotion and the triumph of righteousness. It’s a time to forget differences, forgive past grievances, and strengthen relationships.

Holi’s spirit of fun, unity, and renewal makes it one of the most beloved festivals in India and beyond.
